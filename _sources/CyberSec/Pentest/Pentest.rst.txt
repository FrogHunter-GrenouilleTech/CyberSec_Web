   Pentest

      A pentest (short for penetration testing) is an intrusion test conduct by a Pentester. It is a
      legal hacking session against the Target (who is also the client). It is an Offensive
      security audit. 

      A Pentest is the which of a client who need to know where and what are his weacknesses to be
      able to fix it.

      Before the start, a mutual consent is define between the client and the Pentester. This
      consent must be specifiing the scope of the secuity audit. It also fix the limit and the
      exclusion of the Pentest, like:

         * Do not Crash the production infrastructure
         * Do not attaq this list of server
         * Do not target those users
         * And so on...
