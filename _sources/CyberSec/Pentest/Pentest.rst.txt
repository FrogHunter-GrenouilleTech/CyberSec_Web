   Pentest

      A pentest (short for penetration testing) is an intrusion test conduct by a Pentester. It is a
      legal hacking session against the Target (who is also the client). It is an Offensive
      security audit. 

      A Pentest is the which of a client who need to know where and what are his weacknesses to be
      able to fix it.

      Before the start, a mutual consent is define between the client and the Pentester. This
      consent must be specifiing the scope of the secuity audit. It also fix the limit and the
      exclusion of the Pentest, like:

         * Do not Crash the production infrastructure
         * Do not attaq this list of server
         * Do not target those users
         * And so on...

----------------------------------------------
Organization and conduct of a penetration test
----------------------------------------------

A penetration test generally consists of the following phases:

   * Define the Objective and the Scope 
   * Information gathering (aka Enumeration)
   * Vulnerability identification and assesment
   * Exploitation
   * Clean-up
   * Reporting
   * Elimination or mitigation of vulnerabilities

Penetration Testing Checklist
-----------------------------

    .. note:: 
        
        **Pre-test**

         * Kick-off meeting with the client
            + Define the objectives of the test
            + Identify assets to be tested
            + Determine the scope of the test
            + Set dates and times for the test

         * Gather information about the assets to be tested
            + Information security architecture
            + Information security policies and procedures
            + Software and applications used
            + Known vulnerabilities

         * Prepare the test environment
            + Install the necessary tools and software
            + Set up a secure test environment


    .. note:: 
        
        **Test**

         * Reconnaissance
            + Identify potential entry points
            + Search for vulnerabilities

         * Exploitation
            + Attack identified vulnerabilities
            + Exploit security flaws

         * Post-exploitation
            + Maintain access obtained
            + Collect sensitive information


    .. note:: 
        
        **Post-test**

         * Test report
            + List of identified vulnerabilities
            + Associated risk level
            + Corrective action plan

         * Recommendations
            + Implement corrective security measures
            + Training users on good security practices

Details of each step
====================

Pre-test
--------

:Kick-off meeting with the client:

   * This meeting is essential to define the objectives of the test, identify assets to be tested,
     determine the scope of the test, and set dates and times for the test.

   * It is important to understand the needs of the client and to ensure that the objectives of the
     test are aligned with the security objectives of the client.


:Gather information about the assets to be tested:

   * This step allows you to gather information about the assets to be tested, such as the
     information security architecture, information security policies and procedures, software and applications used, and known vulnerabilities.

   * This information is essential for the reconnaissance phase, which allows you to identify
     potential entry points and known vulnerabilities.


:Prepare the test environment:

   * This step allows you to prepare the test environment by installing the necessary tools and
     software and setting up a secure test environment.

   * It is important to ensure that the test environment is isolated from the real information
     system to avoid contamination.


Test
----

:Reconnaissance:

   * This step involves identifying potential entry points and known vulnerabilities.

   * Reconnaissance techniques may include port scanning, vulnerability scanning, log analysis, etc.


:Exploitation:

   * This step involves exploiting the identified vulnerabilities.

   * Exploitation techniques may include brute-force attacks, SQL injection attacks,
     denial-of-service attacks, etc.


:Post-exploitation:

   * This step involves maintaining access obtained and collecting sensitive information.

   * Post-exploitation techniques may include installing malware, stealing data, modifying data, etc.


Post-test
---------

:Test report:

   * The test report should contain a list of identified vulnerabilities, the associated risk level,
     and a corrective action plan.

   * The test report should be clear and concise, and it should be tailored to the needs of the
     client.


:Recommendations:

   * In addition to the test report, it is important to provide recommendations for implementing
     corrective security measures.

   * These recommendations should be tailored to the needs and objectives of the client.

Conclusion
==========

This checklist is a general guide for conducting a penetration test. It is important to adapt it to
the specific needs of the client and the scope of the test.

Some additional notes
=====================

   * The checklist may be tailored to the specific needs of the client and the scope of the test.

   * It is important to communicate with the client throughout the testing process to ensure that
     the test is meeting their needs.

   * The test results should be communicated to the client in a clear and concise manner.
