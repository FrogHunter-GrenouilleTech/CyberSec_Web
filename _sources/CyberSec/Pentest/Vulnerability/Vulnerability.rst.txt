The vulnerability identification phase is all about using the information already gathered under the
phase one to identify potentials vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain access to a system.
The process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system is also called
a vulnerability assessment. 

A vulnerability assessments can be performed both manually and with automated tools such as 
**Nessus** and **Open-VAS**. The outcome is a list of vulnerabilities found in software and services,
network protocols, misconfigurations and anything else which could possibly lead to exploitation.
The results of the vulnerability assessment are the input data of the exploitation phase where the
vulnerabilities are tested.

   VULNERABILITY

         A vulnerability is any state of an application that allows an attacker to do or know
         something they are not supposed to be able to do or knowing.

         For example, if a website only uses HTTP, that is a vulnerability, because anyone with
         Man-in-the-Middle capabilities can read and modify the data on the site.
