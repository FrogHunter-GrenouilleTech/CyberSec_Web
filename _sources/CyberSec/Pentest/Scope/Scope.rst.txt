Every penetration test begins with a formal written agreement with the client detailing its scope
and objectives. This agreement is the legal authorisation for the penetration tester/ethical hacker
to undertake actions which might otherwise constitute criminal offences.

The agreement must also define the duration of the audit or the Pentest with a start and stop date.
The Pentest have no rights to investigate outside the define range.

Broadly speaking, the purpose of the penetration test is to find possible security errors on the
client’s corporate network or systems that could lead to unauthorized access, damage and/or data
theft.

Successful attacks can typically result from human error such as misconfigurations, unpatched
services, obsolete firmware or operating systems as well as inherent weaknesses in the software
applications used.

In other words, a pen test seeks to identify security weaknesses in an organization’s
network/systems before a hacker can exploit them.
