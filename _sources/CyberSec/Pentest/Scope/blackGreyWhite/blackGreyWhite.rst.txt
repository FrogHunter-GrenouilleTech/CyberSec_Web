We can distinguish 3 types of penetration testing approaches:

    * Black box test
    * Grey box test
    * White box test

The differences lie in: (a) the starting point of the test; and, (b) how much prior knowledge
the penetration tester is given about the targeted systems.

When a black box penetration test is carried out the penetration tester is given little or no prior
information except for the name of the client and maybe a public IP address. Because of the little
information that is given to the penetration tester, this type of approach duplicates the kind of
external attack typically performed by a malicious hacker. Black Box Testing tends to be the more
expensive option since it requires a lot of reconnaissance work which can be extremely labour
intensive.

Malicious attackers can generally afford to spend as much time as it takes to successfully attack a
target, but penetration testers are subject to time and cost constraints and therefore need to work
much more effectively and efficiently.

From an efficiency perspective one can also opt for a grey box penetration test which combines
elements of both black box and white box testing. During a grey box penetration test, the
penetration tester is provided with limited information about the targeted systems. The information
provided may include internal IP addresses, credentials for web applications, diagrams or, indeed,
anything else depending on the test goals and objectives.

White box test
--------------

In a white box test the penetration tester has full knowledge of the target systemâ€™s internal
structure, infrastructure and applications. This may include anything from access credentials,
source code and any other information about the company and targets. The white box approach allows
the penetration tester to perform more rigorous and comprehensive testing because the tester does
not have to dedicate time and resources to acquiring such knowledge.
