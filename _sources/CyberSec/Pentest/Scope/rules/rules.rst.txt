Rules of engagement
-------------------

Another important aspect included in the agreement are the penetration test’s rules of engagement.

Whereas the scope defines ‘what’ will be tested, the rules of engagement define ‘how’ it will be
tested and will set limits to the depth of the test.

For example, a penetration test may attempt to access certain sensitive information (such as a
personnel’s medical records), but the rules of engagement may prohibit the penetration tester from
viewing or downloading such documents.

The rules can also define when the test may be conducted. Some companies, for instance, require
tests to be done outside of office hours in order to minimize impact on business processes. This can
be an important precaution if a **denial-of-service (DoS)** situation unexpectedly arises resulting
in data corruption or network downtime.

            The rules of engagement will determine which exploits can be run against which targets.
            In general, you will never run kernel exploits on production servers because of the
            risks involved, but when a client has cloned the production environment and created a
            separate testing or staging environment, this can be within scope.

The main output of any penetration test is the report. A penetration tester’s report should contain
every detail about any vulnerabilities found and make recommendations on how to fix them. It should
contain enough information for the client’s IT staff to reproduce the security issues and correct
them.
