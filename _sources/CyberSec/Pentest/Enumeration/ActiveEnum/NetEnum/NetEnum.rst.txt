It is good to realize that not every method always works immediately and that results may differ in
different situations.

For example, as a result of tools or (default) settings that change on your penetration testing
system, or parameters in the specific environment in which you work that yield different results
(Local VS VPN for example).

For this reason, it is recommended to not just rely on a single tool or technique and always try
different tools and techniques to enumerate services.

Host discovery
--------------

Host discovery is the process of finding live hosts on a network and is one of the first steps in
network reconnaissance. As a penetration tester we want to be able to identify as many live hosts as
possible on the network, even those that try to hide their presence. There are several tools for
host discovery that use a variety of techniques.

Port scanning is used to probe a server or host for open TCP and UDP ports.

Fingerprinting is the process of identifying the services connected to those ports and their version
numbers.

    .. danger:: 
        
        Port scanning is part of the active information gathering process and should not be 
        performed on hosts without authorization as this could be illegal. Unauthorized port
        scanning can also get your IP blocked and black listed.

    .. important:: 
        
        **Full Scan**
        
        When performing network enumeration, it is always important to run a full port scan on a
        target to make sure you havenâ€™t missed any open ports.
