Information gathering
---------------------

Enumeration is the process of gathering a maximum of informations on a target in order to find 
potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.

This process is essential for an attack to be successful, since wasting time with exploits that
either don't work or can crash the system can be a waste of energy. Enumeration can be used to
gather usernames, passwords, network information, hostnames, application data, services, or any
other information that may be valuable to an attacker.

This phase is probably the most important phase of the penetration test. The informations gathered
here will be the basis for all the following phases and, for this reason, they must be carried out
thoroughly, diligently and with great attention to detail. It is a good practice to revive a
previous search by including the new data collected. 

This process typically starts with information gathering, both passive and active, and focuses on
getting as much information about the target as possible. 

Both Passive and Active enumeration are usually used in parallel. In this way it is possible with
each results of one method can feed the second method for some new exploration.

   Attack Surface

      An application’s attack surface refers to all of the application’s different points that an
      attacker can attempt to exploit.

      The larger the asset scope, the larger the number of target applications and web pages you can
      look at. When a program has a big asset scope, you can often find obscure applications that
      are overlooked by other hackers. This typically means less competition when reporting bugs.
