Passive information gathering is the process of collecting information about a specific target from
publicly available sources that can be accessed by anyone. No brute force or scan port are needed
for those information.

They include search engine data, social media, online databases and even the company website. This
kind of information gathering is all about ‘getting to know your target’ and is usually performed
before starting, or at least as the first step of, the actual penetration test because it may yield
valuable information for later use.

Those activity should be focused on identifying IP addresses, (sub)domains, finding external 
partners and services, the types of technologies used and any other useful information (including
the names of employees working at the company, e-mail addresses, websites, customers, naming
conventions, E-mail & VPN systems and sometimes even passwords).

There are numerous sources that can be used for passive enumeration including:

    * :ref:`Google <ref_gDorks>`, Bing, Yahoo, :ref:`Shodan <ref_shodan>`, Netcraft and other :ref:`Search Engine <ref_searchEngine>`
    * Social media such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook & Instagram
    * Company websites
    * Press releases
    * Discussion forums
    * :ref:`Whois <_ref_Whois>` databases (a resource which may now have been blocked due to the EU’s GDPR legislation)
    * Data Breaches
