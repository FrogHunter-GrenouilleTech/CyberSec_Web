Open Source INTelligence
------------------------

OSInt stands for **Open Source INTelligence**, which refers to any information that can legally be
gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. In practice, that tends to
mean information found on the internet, but technically any public information falls into the 
category of OSINT whether it’s books or reports in a public library, articles in a newspaper or
statements in a press release.

What is OSINT Used For?
=======================

By gathering publicly available sources of information about a particular target an attacker – or
friendly penetration tester – can profile a potential victim to better understand its
characteristics and to narrow down the search area for possible vulnerabilities. Without actively
engaging the target, the attacker can use the intelligence produced to build a threat model and
develop a plan of attack. Targeted cyber attacks, like military attacks, begin with reconnaissance,
and the first stage of digital reconnaissance is passively acquiring intelligence without alerting
the target.

Gathering OSINT on yourself or your business is also a great way to understand what information you
are gifting potential attackers. Once you are aware of what kind of intel can be gathered about you
from public sources, you can use this to help you or your security team develop better defensive
strategies.

    * What vulnerabilities does your public information expose ?
    * What can an attacker learn that they might leverage in a social engineering or phishing attack ?
