There are numerous systems and equipment whose sole purpose is to detect and block intrusion
attempts and malicious elements. For that reson, it can be a good idea to make some "noice" and see
if the security team is able to intercept you.

However, most of the time we need to be as descret as possible. At least, if we can't be discreet.
We need to blur our footprint.

Base64-encoded
--------------

We can download a Base64-encoded malicious executable as text file and decode the executable to
disk. This may help in effectively bypassing security controls such as antivirus, edge devices and
filtering.

:ref:`Cerutil.exe <ref_Certutil>` for exemple is a usefull tool able to encode and decode in base64.
