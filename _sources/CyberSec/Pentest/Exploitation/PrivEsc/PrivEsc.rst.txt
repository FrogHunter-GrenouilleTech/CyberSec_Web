The best info-sec practice is for a user account to run software and services with the lowest
possible privilege level. That way, if the user account is compromised, an attacker’s access to
other areas of the system will be limited. For this reason, shells obtained by exploiting software
and services are often without administrative privileges and the user privileges have to be
‘escalated’ to a higher level to gain sufficient control over the target system. This is done by
performing a further vulnerability assessment to identify what can be done to escalate the standard
user privileges to those of a systems administrator.
