In the exploitation phase, the vulnerabilities that have been identified are tested and exploited as
far as the rules of engagement allow.

The penetration tester will break into the target using exploits, zero days, social engineering
attacks, physical attacks, malware, password attacks, eavesdropping and anything else permitted by
the agreement with the client.

This phase is the practical side of exploitation where exploits are analysed, modified and executed
against the target system. The best possible outcome is a ‘root’ or ‘system shell’ with
administrative privileges on the target system.

Whithin a security audit or a pentest, the explotation will emphase the weacknesses of an
infrastructure. In case of a real malicious attaq, it can lead to the stealling and the cryptage of
the data, to converting of an equipement as a mining plateforme or a bounce server for the attaq
against other target.

    .. warning:: 
        
        **Remember**
                
         It is important to remember that every vulnerabilities are not exploitable. A large part of
         the exploitation phase, constist to the elimination of those parasitic vulnerabilities.
         After that it is possible to exploit the vulnerabilities with a real threat potential.

vulnerabilities with a hight CVSS score are the easyest to exploit. In many case, there is no hight
vulnerability availlable. If there are medium vulnerabilities it is then possible to chain the
exploit of those medium vulnerabilities to compromise the target.

-----------------
Exploitation type
-----------------

There are several type of possible exploitation.

:Manually running a script to a target:

      Those script can be found from different source like "Rapid7", "Exploit-DB", "searchsploit", and
      so on. Some time the exploit need to be executing with a payload which is another script that is
      open a backdoor or a reverse shell.


:Running an automatic exploit through a framework like "Metasploit":

      This is a simpliest methode than the manual methode. Most of the time only a few varriable hab to
      be fullfil. Some payload can either be necessary. Metasploit has it own search engine to find the
      exploit. However, It is possible to find a new exploit from "Rapid7" or "Exploit-DB". Those
      exploit can then be imported from Metasploit.


:Compiling an exploit and run the binnary from the target:

      Some target need compilated binnary rather than a interpreted script. For exemple this is
      sometime needed for the Linux Kernel. When it'is possible, it is better to compile the exploit
      from the target since every compiled elements is locally present. No need to provide some
      external librairy. Most of the time the compilation instructions are provided on the top of the
      exploit script.

Each of those method can be mixed with the others.

   PAYLOAD

         A payload is something that can be executed when using an exploit. For example, a
         vulnerability allows to execute any code when an e-Mail attachment is open. That piece of
         code that I execute then is the payload.

         For demonstration purposes, some payloads just start calc.exe on Windows. Some other raise
         an alert message from a browser. This demonstrates that "any" code can be run. Of course,
         malicious payloads do much worse, such as adding backdoors, stealing or encrypting data,
         etc...

         Simply put, the payload is "the thing you want to get from A to B".
