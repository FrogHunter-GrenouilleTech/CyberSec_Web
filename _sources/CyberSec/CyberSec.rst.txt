   Red Team
   
      That's the name usual name for the offensive team. Pentesters and Bug Bounty hunters are a
      part of this team. The objectif of a the Red Team is to find and exploit every little crack or
      weakness of a target.

      A target can be a Web Application, an equipment, an enterprise or an organization.


   :ref:`Blue Team <ref_BlueTeam>`

      That's the usual name of the defensive Team. The team's goal is to find and fix every little
      crack and weakness of their target. Most of the time those task are performed by the IT Team
      or the RSSI.

      The other big task of the Blue Team is the Incidente response for whom It is necessary to
      performe forensic analysis, guessing and the consultation of many event logs.


   Purple Team

      The Purple Team is the new trend. It aims to bound mix the Blue and the Red Team. For the Red
      Team, it is necessary to provide a report and suggest a solution for every vulnerability. On
      the other hand, it is a good practice for the Blue to know how attackers act. So Since
      Red+Blue=Purple, the distinction between offensive and defensive teams becomes less present.
