There is a large quantity of tools for the cyber security. Some are for specific task only, some are
usable for mulple task. Some dedicated for the offensive Team, some for the Defense Team and some
are for both. In the same way, some of the tools are Free, some not and some a little bit of both.

It is neccessary to stay alert for the new tools since a tool can be outdated at any time. There are
also some "must have" tools that we need to mastering.
