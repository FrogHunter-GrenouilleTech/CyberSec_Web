What is a Payload?
------------------

A payload is a piece of code or data that is delivered to a target system as part of an attack or
testing process. It is the component of an exploit that performs the intended action, such as
executing a command, stealing data, or causing a denial of service. Payloads can vary widely in
complexity and purpose, and they are commonly used in various contexts, including:

    - **Fuzzing**: In security testing, fuzzing involves sending random or unexpected data
      (payloads) to an application to identify vulnerabilities. The goal is to crash the application
      or trigger unexpected behavior, which can reveal security flaws.

    - **Web Proxy**: Payloads can be used in web proxies to manipulate requests and responses
      between clients and servers. This can be useful for testing web applications, intercepting
      traffic, or injecting malicious content.

    - **Exploits**: In the context of exploits, a payload is the code that is executed after
    successfully compromising a system. This can include installing malware, creating a backdoor, or
    executing commands on the target machine.

Understanding payloads and their applications is crucial for both security professionals and
attackers, as they play a central role in the effectiveness of various security testing and
exploitation techniques.
