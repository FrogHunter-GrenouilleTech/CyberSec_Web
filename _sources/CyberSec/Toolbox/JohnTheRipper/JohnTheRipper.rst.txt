John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix, macOS,
Windows, DOS, BeOS, and OpenVMS (the latter requires a contributed patch). Its primary purpose is to
detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly found on
various Unix flavors, supported out of the box are Kerberos/AFS and Windows LM hashes, as well as
DES-based tripcodes, plus hundreds of additional hashes and ciphers in "-jumbo" versions.
