**pwncat** is a sophisticated bind and reverse shell handler with many features as well as a drop-in
replacement or compatible complement to netcat, ncat or socat.

pwncat is a fully compatible netcat fork written in Python with many more aggressive network
features on top.

    "Netcat on steroids with Firewall, IDS/IPS evasion, bind and reverse shell, self-injecting shell
    and port forwarding magic - and its fully scriptable with Python (PSE). "

It comes with a Python Scripting Engine (PSE) that allows you to manipulate incoming and outgoing
traffic to your needs. This can reach from wrapping current TCP/UDP traffic into higher protocols
such as HTTP, FTP, Telnet, etc or even go to encrypting and decrypting your traffic.

Besides regular netcat features like full IPv4, IPv6 and UDP/TCP, IP ToS, port scanning,
server/client, bind- and reverse shells, it also comes with pivoting features, ssh-less local and
remote port-forwarding, port-hopping, target self-injection and many more.
