PwnDoc-NG is a fork of PwnDoc.

PwnDoc-ng is a pentest reporting application making it simple and easy to write your findings and generate a customizable Docx report. It is based on original fork of PwnDoc work by yeln4ts. The main goal is to have more time to Pwn and less time to Doc by mutualizing data like vulnerabilities between users.
