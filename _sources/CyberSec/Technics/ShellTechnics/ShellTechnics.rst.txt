####

There are three main types of shells: 

    * **Reverse Shell**: Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection.
    
    * **Bind Shell**: Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do.

    * **Web Shell**: Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output.
