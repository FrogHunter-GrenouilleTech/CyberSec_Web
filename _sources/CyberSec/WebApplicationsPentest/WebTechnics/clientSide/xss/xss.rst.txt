HTML Injection vulnerabilities can often be utilized to also perform **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
attacks by injecting JavaScript code to **be executed on the client-side**. Once we can execute code
on the victim's machine, we can potentially gain access to the victim's account or even their
machine. XSS involves the injection of JavaScript code to perform more advanced attacks on the
client-side

There are three main types of XSS:

    .. note:: 
        
        **Reflected XSS**

        Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after processing (e.g., search result or
        error message).

    
    .. note:: 
        
        **Stored XSS**

        Occurs when user input is stored in the back end database and then displayed upon
        retrieval (e.g., posts or comments).
    

    .. note:: 
        
        **DOM XSS**

        Occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is written to an HTML DOM object
        (e.g., vulnerable username or page title).
