Web application penetration testing techniques involve a systematic approach to identifying and
exploiting vulnerabilities in web-based applications. These techniques include:

    1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target application
    2. Mapping the application: Identifying entry points and functionalities
    3. Vulnerability scanning: Using automated tools to detect potential weaknesses
    4. Manual testing: Probing for vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss
    5. Exploitation: Attempting to leverage discovered vulnerabilities
    6. Reporting: Documenting findings and providing recommendations for remediation

Common focus areas include authentication bypass, injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS),
insecure direct object references (IDOR), and security misconfigurations. Pentesters must stay
updated on the latest attack vectors and security best practices to effectively assess web
application security.
