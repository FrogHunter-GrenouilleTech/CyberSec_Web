**Web Reconnaissance** is the foundation of a thorought security assessment.

This process invloves systematically and meticulously collecting information about a target or a web
application. Think of it as the preparatory phase before delving into deeper analysis and potential
exploitation.

It form a critical part of the **"Information Gathering"** phase of the Penetration Testing Process.

The primary goals of web Reconnaissance include:

    * **Indentifying Assets**: Uncovering all publicly accessible components of the target, sauch as
      web pages, subdomains, IP adresses, and technologies used.

      This step provides a comprehensive overview of the target's online presence.


    * **Discovering Hiden Information**: Lacting sensitive information that might be inadvertently
      exposed, including backup files, configuration files, or internal documentation.

      These findings can reveal valuable insights entry points for attacks.


    * **Analysing th Attack Surface**: Examining the target's attack surface to identify potential
      vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This involves assessing the technlogies used, configurations,
      and possible entry points for exploitation.


    * **Gathering Intelligence**: Collecting Information that can be leveraged for further
      exploitation or social engineering attacks. THis includes identifying key personnel, email
      addresses, or patterns of behaviour that could be exploited.

Types of Reconnaissance
-----------------------

Web reconnaissance encompasses two fundamental methodologies: :ref:`Active <ref_webReconActive>` and
:ref:`Passive <ref_webReconPassive>` reconnaissance. Each approach offers distinct advantages and
challenges, and understanding their differences is crucial for adequate information gathering.
