This course will provide you an insight into the darkweb, and exactly what it’s used for, by both
the good guys and the bad guys. We’ll explore the use of TOR for privacy, the role the darkweb plays
in intelligence gathering (for both law enforcement and threat intelligence companies), and get you
exploring some safe areas of TOR.

Before we dive into the blackness of the darkweb (it’s not all bad though!) we first need to explore
how the internet is split up into three regions known as; 

    * The Clear Web
    * The Deep Web
    * The Dark Web.

----------------------
What is the Clear Web?
----------------------

This part of the internet has many names, such as; **The Clear Web**, **Surface Web**, and **Indexed
Web**. These are the sites that you access daily, such as Facebook, Google, YouTube, Reddit, and so
on. These websites and web pages are indexed on a mass scale by search engines such as Google and
Bing, which is why we can find them when using search engines.

The Clear Web consists of legal sites that are generally designed for use by the public, and tend
not to have obscure methods of gaining access, such as a special key or IP whitelisting.

What is the Deep Web?
---------------------

The Deep Web, also known as the **Underground Web** or **Invisible Web**, is the part of the
Internet that isn’t indexed by conventional search engines, such as Google or Bing. Either the site
owners have prevented crawlers from indexing their site, or they have implemented access controls to
only allowed their intended audience to access the site. The Deep Web is huge.

Are the Dark Web and the Deep Web the same thing?
=================================================

**No**! They’re different. Log in to your Amazon account – you’re on the Deep Web. Sign in to your
Facebook – you’re on the Deep Web. These are web pages that are not indexed or publicly available,
imagine if anyone could search on Google and find your private Amazon page with your order history,
payment details, and more private information. Not everything on the Deep Web is illegal or shady,
it’s just private pages that only certain people should have access to. Other examples include
private forums, private membership pages, and online banking.

---------------------
What is the Dark Web?
---------------------

A section of the internet that is utilized for anonymity, illegal operations, intelligence gathering,
and more. Whilst some search engines do exist for the Dark Web, sites are usually hidden, and you’ll
need to know the exact URL in order to find them. Sites on the Dark Web use the **Top Level Domain**
(TLD) **‘.onion’** as opposed to Clear Web TLDs such as **‘.com’** or **‘.co.uk’**.

is it illegal to visit the Dark Web?
====================================

Regardless of your geographical location, it is not illegal to visit the Dark Web. Whilst accessing
the Dark Web isn’t illegal, there is a large amount of illegal content, and viewing this or
interacting with it could substitute an illegal offense.

Why is it Useful?
-----------------

The Dark Web has a number of benefits, and not just for cybercriminals. When considering its
legitimate use, there are a number of obvious benefits.

    .. note:: 
        
       **Threat Intelligence Collection**

            A large amount of useful intelligence can be gathered from the dark web, such as malware
            and vulnerabilities for sale (which can help researchers and companies to fix these
            holes before they’re exploited on a mass scale), uncovering planning of cyberattacks on
            private forums (this intelligence can be used to inform the target organization so they
            can implement defenses), tracking threat actors online (attempting to uncover the
            identities of advanced hackers so they can be arrested for their crimes), and much more.


    .. note::

       **Law Enforcement Operations**

            Using the dark web, law enforcement officers can infiltrate private sites, forums, and
            marketplaces in order to collect evidence that would be used in the case of legal
            prosecution against individuals involved in illegal activity. By joining the criminals
            in cyberspace, police officers and other law enforcement units are able to take the
            fight straight to the bad guys, and work to shut down sites, collect intelligence, and
            disrupt criminal operations.


    .. note::

       **Freedom of Speech**

            In some countries the government works to closely monitor all communications and remove
            any that they do not agree with, an act called censorship. Using TOR, individuals from
            these countries can bypass internet restrictions such as website blocking, or get
            messages out to the wider world, letting them know what’s happening in their location.

    .. note::

       **Privacy**

            Whilst TOR does not provide 100% anonymity, it does provide more security in terms of
            privacy than using a normal browser such as Chrome. Due to the way TOR operates, your
            IP will be masked by a number of nodes, working like a VPN to hide your true address.
