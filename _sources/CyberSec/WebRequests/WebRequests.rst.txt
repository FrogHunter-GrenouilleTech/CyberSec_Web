Web requests are HTTP requests sent from a client (like a web browser or an API client) to a server
to retrieve or modify resources on the web. Understanding how web requests work is important for web
development, security, and interacting with APIs. 

Key aspects of web requests:

    - Use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to retrieve or modify resources
    - Include headers with metadata about the request and response  
    - Can contain body content like JSON or form data
    - Follow request-response cycle - server returns status codes and response content
    - URLs identify resources, and parameters/query strings can pass data
    - Cookies and sessions manage state between requests

Mastering web requests allows building robust web apps and APIs. For security, it helps identify
vulnerabilities through improper handling of requests.
