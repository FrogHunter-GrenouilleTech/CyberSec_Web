Document
--------

Every step of a process should be documented. This is the best way to keep track of what you did.

This documentation could be used to write a report, to help you remember what you did previously or
to help you to find a new idea when you're stuck.

The documentation has no need to be yours. An old report from a coworkers, a writeup or a PoC can be
useful.

Since one goal of the documentation is to pic some knowledge, along the way. It is always a good
idea rewrite and reformat the document you find. It is always possible to complete it later.

        **Trace and Log**

        In some case you need to justify yourself by proving that "it is not your fault if internet
        or break down juste because you are in the building".

        When you start an audit, set up the logs and the trace. It will help you to justify yourself.

Writing a report is a part of the documentation process. It is the way to share your work with your
team, your client or your boss.

There several type of report.

    * The bug report
    * The CVE / CVSS report
    * The pentest report
    * The security audit report
    * The CTF report

Some of theme are extremly concise and factual. Others are more narrative and describe the process.
It depend on the audience. a tech guy will prefer a concise report. A manager will prefer a more narrative report.

Most of the time you will write only one report. for both the technician and the manager.
