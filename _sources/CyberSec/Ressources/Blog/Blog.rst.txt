This project is aimed at providing technical guides on various hacking topics. The most advanced
topics are Active Directory and Web services. Other topics will be added. The ultimate goal is
centralize all hacking techniques.

Cheatsheets are huge resources, but they sometimes lack simplicity or on the contrary they don't
give enough context or explanation. This is not a cheatsheets project. Everything here will be
verified, tested, and not only copy-pasted from I don't know where.

This project is not the only one around focusing on providing ethical hacking guides. You should
also take a look at **hacktricks** and **ired.team**.

Keep in mind that these guides are maintained by non-omniscient security enthusiasts in their spare
time. You will probably find things missing or mistakes and writing all this takes time.
