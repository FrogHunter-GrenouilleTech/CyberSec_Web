The intention of this post is to provide basic queries for targeted AD DS information gathering used
in penetration testing. The reader can pick their poison when deciding how to deliver them.

Some delivery method examples include vbscript, powershell (i.e. adsi and adsisearcher type
accelerators), dsquery, ADExplorer, AdsiEdit, javascript, win32API, .NET languages, ldapsearch,
adfind, adsearch, and likely many others.

Equally, defenders can use these queries to test their detection capabilities when large traffic
spikes may not be produced, see what attackers will see from various perspectives within their
environment, and aid to remediate domain privilege escalation and lateral movement opportunities
from breach hosts.
